# SNOBOL4 Web Interpreter

## Built on CSNOBOL4

This project is built upon **CSNOBOL4** by Phil Budne - a faithful implementation of the SNOBOL4 programming language originally developed at Bell Labs.

### About CSNOBOL4
- **Developer:** Phil Budne

- **License:** BSD-style (permissive open source)

CSNOBOL4 is a complete implementation of the SNOBOL4 language as described in "The SNOBOL4 Programming Language" by Griswold, Poage, and Polonsky (1971). It provides all the features of the original Bell Labs SNOBOL4 interpreter with modern enhancements and cross-platform compatibility.

### Historical Context

**SNOBOL4** (String Oriented Symbolic Language) was developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s-70s by:
- Ralph Griswold
- David Farber  
- Ivan Polonsky

It pioneered many concepts in string processing and pattern matching that influenced modern programming languages.

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- **Phil Budne** for maintaining and developing CSNOBOL4, preserving this important piece of computing history
- **The original SNOBOL4 team at Bell Labs** for creating this innovative language
- **The SNOBOL4 community** for keeping the language alive and relevant

### License Compliance

This project uses CSNOBOL4 under its BSD-style license. Full license terms available at the CSNOBOL4 website.
